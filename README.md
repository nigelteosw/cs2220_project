# CS2220 Project: Protein Interaction Energy Database
This repository houses the project dedicated to the development of a comprehensive database system for calculating and storing interaction energy data between two proteins.

## Project Components:
### Frontend Development:
**React**
- The project includes a frontend interface built with React, offering a user-friendly experience for interacting with the database.
**React Bootstrap**
- Utilize React Bootstrap components to design and layout the frontend, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface.
**HTML and CSS**
- The frontend leverages HTML and CSS for structure and styling, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing user interface.
**JavaScript**
- JavaScript is employed to enhance user interactions and provide dynamic functionality within the React-based frontend.

### Backend Development:
**Node.js**
- The project features a robust Node.js backend server responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving the React frontend.
**MySQL**
- A MySQL database is utilized to store and manage interaction energy data. The backend, implemented in Node.js, facilitates seamless interaction with this database.
**API Development**
- The backend is equipped with API endpoints, enabling effective communication between the frontend and backend components. These endpoints serve as the gateway for data retrieval and storage.

### Deployment:
**Vercel**
- The React frontend is deployed using Vercel, ensuring accessibility and reliability for end-users. Configuration settings are optimized for a smooth and efficient deployment process.

This project aims to deliver a powerful and user-friendly database system capable of calculating and storing protein interaction energy data efficiently. With the frontend and backend components, along with the integration of a MySQL database, it provides a comprehensive solution for managing and accessing this critical scientific information.
